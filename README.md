- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cas9Diego
- 👀 I’m interested in FrontEnd development, altough I am very corious about BackEnd development, however my knowledge in that field is limited but constantly increasing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FrontEnd and BackEnd development at the University Federico II.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FrontEnd and BackEnd Development projects. So far I have worked mostly in Swift projects, but I look forward to learn other languages such as Java, React, Node, CSS, SQL and others.
